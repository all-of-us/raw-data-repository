"""NDB model and DAO for logs of writes that can be synced.

Sync log entries provide a strongly consistent feed of participant changes, so clients can keep 
their models up to date and notify end users of change events.

Each sync channel has a configurable number of shards, each with its own SyncCounter row.
These counters are incremented as records are written to the log; each record has the new value
of the counter as the ID part of its key. Each shard is its own entity group; this allows for 
higher write QPS than having only a single entity group per channel.

Calls to the sync() method retrieve resources from the log in increasing ID order, across all 
shards. Because they are in the same entity group, reads from a shard are guaranteed to reflect
all previous calls to write_log_entry for that shard. (This is in contrast to reads from secondary
indexes, where no such guarantees exist.)

Writes are sharded based on a hash of the ID for the participant being written about. This
guarantees that resources for the same participant will be returned to the client in the
order they were written.
