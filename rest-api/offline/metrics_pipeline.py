"""Offline process for calculating metrics.

This is mapreduce that goes over the history tables and dumps summaries into
MetricsBucket entities.

In order to segregate metrics from one run from another, a MetricsVersion record
is created at the beginning of each run.  At the end of the run its 'completed'
property is set to true.  For every MetricsBucket that is created by this
pipeline, its parent is set to the current MetricsVersion.

The metrics to be collected are specified in the METRICS_CONFIGS dict.  In
addition to the fields specified there, for evey entity, a synthetic 'total'
metric is generated.  This is to record the total number of entities over time.

map_key_to_summary
------------------

The mapper, 'map_key_to_summary', takes as input a key for a single entity.
That key is passed to the load_history_func as defined in the METRICS_CONFIGS.

The load_history_func will return an array (not necessarily sorted) of history
object related to this entity.  Note that not all of the history objects need to
be of the type of the entity.  It may make sense to also include history objects
for objects that are children of this entity.

The 'fields' section of the METRICS_CONFIGS dictates which fields are to be
derived from each of the possible history objects, as well as functions for
extracting those values.

Next the algorithm goes over each of the history entries, in chronological
order, extracting fields.  When a value appears on an entity for the
first time, a "+1" is generated for that value.  When that value changes to
something else, a "+1" is created for the new value, and a "-1" is created for
the old one (on the date that it changes).

Note about facets: The summarized metrics are aggregate by dimensions referred
to as facets.  If a value that defines a facet changes between two history
objects, a summary containing all fields is emitted twice, once for the old
facet (with all -1s), and once for the new facet, (with all 1s).

The output from the mapper is objects of the form: (for Participant)
Key: {'date': '2016-10-02', 'facets': [{'type': 'hpo_id', 'value': 'jackson'}]}
Value:
{
  summary: {
    "Participant.Participant.race.asian": 1,
    "Participant.age_range.36-45": 1,
}

reduce_facets
-------------------
The reducer, 'reduce_facets', takes all the output from the mapper for a given
key, adds them up, and writes out the aggregated counts.
