## OPS-DATA API

The ops-data API offers access to the `ParticipantSummary` resource and represents an aggregated view of relevant
participant details, including data from consent (name, contact information),
from PPI modules (a status indicating whether the participant has completed
each questionnaire), basic demographics (age, gender, race).

This API can be accessed using the [ops-data-service].
This service will provide you with a Jupyter Notebook with further documentation.

See the ops-data-service [install instructions][ops-data-service-docs].
