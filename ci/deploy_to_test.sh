# Deploys the application to the project $1.

# This script is executed by the circle.yml config when the conditions
# specified there are met.

# Requires two environment variables (see below) which combine to decrypt
# the keys for a service account.

# The AppEngine Admin API must be activated for the project being deployed
# to (it is not activated by default).

# The service account must have permissions as described here:
# https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/access-control

# 1. In particular it requires project editor permission: this is currently
# required to push queues.yaml, cron.yaml, and index.yaml.

# 2. It must also have write access to the two Cloud Storage buckets used
# for staging the deployment - this comes automatically with project editor
# status.

# In the future it will likely be possible to grant weaker permissions
# (such as the AppEngine Deployer role).
