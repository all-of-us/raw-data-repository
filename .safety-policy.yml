# Safety Security and License Configuration file
# We recommend checking this file into your source control in the root of your Python project
# If this file is named .safety-policy.yml and is in the same directory where you run `safety check` it will be used by default.
# Otherwise, you can use the flag `safety check --policy-file <path-to-this-file>` to specify a custom location and name for the file.
# To validate and review your policy file, run the validate command: `safety validate policy_file --path <path-to-this-file>`

    ignore-cvss-severity-below: 0 # A severity number between 0 and 10. Some helpful reference points: 9=ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL severity. 7=ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL & HIGH severity. 4=ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL, HIGH & MEDIUM severity.
    ignore-cvss-unknown-severity: False # True or False. We recommend you set this to False.
    continue-on-vulnerability-error: False # Suppress non-zero exit codes when vulnerabilities are found. Enable this in pipelines and CI/CD processes if you want to pass builds that have vulnerabilities. We recommend you set this to False.
