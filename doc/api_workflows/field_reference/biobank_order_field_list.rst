BioBank Order Field List
============================================================
.. glossary::
  Participant id
    The globally unique ID known by participants and all groups, generated by the DRC when the PTC calls the create participant API

  Order id
    The globally unique ID created by HealthPro when a biobank order is created. This order ID is pushed to MayoLINK when the biobank order is created in their system. As requested/suggested by Mayo, it should be 12 alphanumeric characters long.

  Tube type
    This will be a MayoLink test identifier.
    Current values include: 1ED10, 2ED10, 1ED04, 1SST8, 1PST8, 1HEP4, 1UR10, 1SAL

  Timestamp: created
    The time at which a HealthPro user creates a biobank order. Autogenerated by HealthPro.

  Timestamp: collected
    The time at which biobank sample collection is completed. Input by user.

  Timestamp: processed
    The time at which this tube’s processing (i.e. centrifugation) is completed. Input by user.

  Timestamp: finalized
    The time at which samples for a biobank order are ready for shipment to Mayo (i.e. Samples have been collected, processed, and prepared for shipment). Input by user.

  Collected samples
    (array of sample numbers, e.g. [1,2,5])
    A list of sample numbers which were successfully collected from the participant, for a single biobank order. This list will always be a subset of the 7 samples listed above.

  Processed samples
    (array of sample numbers, e.g. [1,2,5])
    A list of sample numbers which were successfully processed (processed = additional required steps beyond simple refrigeration such as centrifugation or container transfer), for a single biobank order.

  Finalized samples
    (array of sample numbers, e.g. [1,2,5])
    A list of sample numbers for a biobank order are ready for shipment to Mayo. The research associates on site are responsible for packaging the samples in a biohazard bag, checking the samples within against the sample order manifest, and placing the bag in a refrigerator at a designated location on site. This list specifies which samples are ready for are refrigerated and ready for courier pick-up.

  Collected notes
    (string)
    Text inputted by the user to capture additional notes relevant to the sample collection process (ex. “incomplete draw for EDTA sample number 1. Only 2 of the required 4 mL were drawn”)

  Processed notes
    (string)
    Text inputted by the user to capture additional notes relevant to the sample processing process (ex. “Centrifuge was not cooled to the proper temperature for blood spin down. All samples were spun at RT instead of 4C”)

  Finalized notes
    (string)
    Text inputted by the user to capture additional notes relevant to the sample finalization process (ex. “Samples are prepared for shipment and stored in the 4C fridge in Room 520A”)
