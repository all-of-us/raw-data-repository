Genomic System
************************************************************

Overview
============================================================
The overall goal of the Data and Research Core (DRC) in Genomics is to facilitate data flows required for Program operations,
return of genetic results to Participants, and genomic analysis by All of Us researchers.

Components
============================================================
Biosample information and genetic analysis results data pipelines between the All of Us Biobank, DRC, Genome Centers (GCs), and clinical annotation sites required for operations.
Data pipelines between GCs and DRC, and within the DRC that provide sequencing and clinical report data to researchers

Workflows
============================================================
These pipelines facilitate transfer of genomic clinical report data back to participants.
